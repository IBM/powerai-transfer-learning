    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is the process of taking a pre-trained model (the weights and parameters of a network that has been trained on a large dataset by somebody else) and “fine-tuning” the model with your own dataset. The idea is that this pre-trained model will act as a feature extractor. You will remove the last layer of the network and replace it with your own classifier (depending on what your problem space is). You then freeze the weights of all the other layers and train the network normally (Freezing the layers means not changing the weights during gradient descent/optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment we used Google's Inception-V3 pretrained model for Image Classification. This model consists of two parts:\n",
    "    - Feature extraction part with a convolutional neural network.\n",
    "    - Classification part with fully-connected and softmax layers.\n",
    "The pre-trained Inception-v3 model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for recognizing general objects with 1000 classes. The model extracts general features from input images in the first part and classifies them based on those features in the second part.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this pre-trained model and re-train it it to classify aerial views of houses which have a swimming pool in their backyard. In order to do so we will build a new image dataset with aerial views coming from Google Images. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following chart shows how the data flows in the Inception v3 model, which is a Convolutional Neural Network with many layers and a complicated structure. "

Since you don't have to train the feature extraction part (which is the most complex part of the model), you can train the model with less computational resources and training time."

    "The final test accuracy is **~85%**  for our two classes **House** and **House + Pool** which is quite substantial given our training set contained approxiamtely only ~300 images for each classes. This is where Transfer Learning really shines. All what we did was to use the trained Inception Model which already had learned basic features of lines, shapes and other features that increase in abstraction as we move towards the final layers of the model. We basically retrained the last layers where we supplied training images of Houses and House + Pools and the model using its pre-learnt features.  "

Be sure that the pre-trained model you have selected has been trained on a similar data set as the one that you wish to use it on. There are various architectures people have tried on different types of data sets and I strongly encourage you to go through these architectures and apply them to your own problem statements.\n"
